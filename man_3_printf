.B Format of the format string
.RS 3
The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any. The format string is composed of zero or more  directives: ordinary  characters  (not  %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching  zero  or  more subsequen arguments.  Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier.
By default, the arguments are used in the order given.
.RE

.B The conversion specifier
.RS 3
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

.B d, i
.RS 6
The \int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
.RE

.B c
.RS 6
The \int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.
.RE

.B s
.RS 6
The \const char  argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string).  Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0').
